## Project Structure

### Main Components

1. **`MainActivity`**:
   - Entry point of the application.
   - Sets up the UI using Jetpack Compose.
   - Loads the cat data from a JSON file (`cats_info.json`).
   - Shows the conetnt of app in a Box and by calling `AllSections()` composable function.

2. **Data Model**:
   - `CatBreed`: A class for storing cat data such as `name`, `description`, and `imageResId`.

3. **Utility Function**:
   - `loadDataFromJson`: Parses the JSON file to read cats information.
  
4. **Composable Functions**:
   - **`AppHeader`**: Displays the app title and header image, which are stored in a Column.
   - **`AppSection`**: Displays a single cat breed's name and a toggleable button for details. A hoist state called `expanded` is defined here and when the state of this variable changes when the button is presseed. If the `expanded.value` is True, then the `CatDetails()` function is called to show more information about the cat.
   - **`CatDetails`**: Shows the description and image of the cat breed when expanded.
   - **`AllSections`**: This function is implemented using LazyColumn, which is scrollable, and it contains `AppHeader()` and `AppSection()`.
